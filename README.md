This SW provides procedures and fucntions for handling surreal numbers and their conversion to/from decimals, integers, and fractions. 
It also provides procedures for addition, subtraction, sign change, multiplication, inversion, and division operations between surreal numbers.
A surreal number X is a pair of two lists each of which recursively contains surreal numbers:
X = (LEFTX,RIGHTX)
LEFTX = [Xl1,Xl2,...,Xln]
RIGHTX = [Xr1,Xr2,...,Xrm]
where Xl1,Xl2,...Xln and Xr1,Xr2,...,Xrm are surreal numbers such 
that it does not exist Xli greater or equal Xrj for any i,j.

Surreal numbers are more than hyperreal and hyperreal numbers, and can easily represent games and decision trees without random options and with full knowledge of the decision environment.
